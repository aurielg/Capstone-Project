#Capstone Project Proposal 

*Academic achievement is a mysterious topic for educators and researchers alike.  Understanding the factors that contribute to academic success and failure is essential when trying to provide a quality education to students from differing backgrounds.  Studies have argued the extent to which variables such as class size, teacher quality, socio-economic class, and family background, just to name a few, impact students’ performance in school.  Based on one’s social and demographic factors, can we reliably predict the educational outcomes of a student?  This information would be extremely valuable to government agency, nonprofits and educational think-tanks who work toward improving education systems across the world. In this project, I will seek and answer to this question with the goal of creating a formula to predict student grades based on personal attributes. 

*This project will utilize survey data conducted on secondary students enrolled in math and Portuguese classes. The data is taken from Kaggle. It is fairly clean but will need to be wrangled to prioritize certain variables. I will broadly analyze the data to uncover any patterns, which will allow me to filter out the variables that I will focus on. I predict that some of the most useful variable will relate to students’ extracurricular activities and study time.  Ultimately, I will create an algorithm for predicting students’ final grade. My results will be delivered in the form of code, a written report and presentation.   

*My target audiences are local government education agencies. With this information, agencies can design a research initiative to take place in area school districts where student attributes are analyzed and outcomes predicted using the results of this project. Using this information, the government and/or school district can pin point those schools that will likely need the most support. Also, this will reveal the main factors contributing to poor predicted outcomes which will indicate the types of supports that will be most effective in improving scores at a given school or school system. With this knowledge schools, districts, and counties could greatly improve student achievement with pointed supports, getting closer to the goal of educational equity for all students.
